# Rarities MUST be listed in order of ID number and chance (Most common to least common)
# ID numbers are arbitrary (they are used internally by the plugin to keep track of a rarity even if the name changes)
# You can add new (and remove old) rarities as you see fit as long as you edit the ID's to match
# The ID does not have to go in increments of 100. That is just used so that you have room for rarities in between
# The chances don't HAVE to add up to 100% but you'll get more accurate probabilities if they do
# Effect chance is chance that loot of that rarity will have ANY effect

# AcuteLoot uses name generator patterns to create loot names.
# These patterns are created and customized using the options below.
# A name pool is a list of name parts that can be referenced in a name generator pattern.
# There are currently two types of name pools:
# * common: a fixed list of name parts provided in a txt file
# * material: a list of names for each material
#   NOTE: Instead of providing a file, provide a directory that contains separate files for each material type
# You can create your own name pools and use your own files. The default files are included with the plugin.

# A name generator is defined by its pattern
# A pattern is made up of name pool tags, spaces, and any other text (typically a conjunction)
# The tags MUST match the name field of an existing name pool
# NOTE: Any leading and trailing spaces in a pattern will be removed,
# ... and any multi-space sections will be collapsed down to a single space.
# Rarity is proportional, meaning it doesn't strictly have to add up to 100%
# The (a-b) syntax will make the name pool repeat between a and b times (currently only used in the kana generator)
# You can create your own name generators. There are five included by default
